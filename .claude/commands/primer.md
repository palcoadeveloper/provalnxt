Use the command tree to get an understanding of the project structure.

Start with reading the CLAUDE.md file if it exists to get an understanding of the project.

Read the SECURITY_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md, TWO_FACTOR_AUTHENTICATION_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md, DATABASE_CODEBASE_CORRELATION_ANALYSIS.md, TEST_DATA_ENTRY_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md,FILE_PATH_UTILS_DOCUMENTATION.md, ADD_REMARKS_MODAL_DOCUMENTATION.md, WORKFLOW_DOCUMENTATION.md, MODERN_UI_STYLING_DOCUMENTATION.md, CONFIGURABLE_SESSION_MANAGEMENT.md,CONNECTIVITY_MONITORING_DOCUMENTATION.md, SESSION_CONFIG_QUICK_REFERENCE.md, MANUAL_SESSION_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md and SECURITY_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md files to get an understanding of the project.

Read key files in the public/, core/ directory.

IMPORTANT: Use Serena to search through the codebase. If you get any errors using Serena, retry with different Serena tools.

Explain back to me:

Project structure
Project purpose and goals
Key files and their purposes
Any important dependencies
Any important configuration files
